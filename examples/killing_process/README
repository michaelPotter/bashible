expects bashible to be installed in /usr/local/bin (including it's modules)

This example demonstrates killing parent process which will kill it's children. In pure bash, children processes stay alive unless you run the script in interactive mode.

usage:

bashible ./main.bash

CTRL-C or send SIGTERM to the main process
