0.1.0
  - versioning changed to follow semver.org's rules
  
  - default script extension is .ble
  
  - conditional block execution has been changed
  
    use '@ when' before a block starts (or multiple when to achieve AND)

    @ when true
    @ Doing something...
      - ls /

    @ when false
    @ Not doing anything...
      - ls /tmp

    @ Doing always...
      - ls /home
    
    @ when foo
    @ when bar
    @ Executed if foo and bar matches
      - baz

    In previous versions of bashible, 'when' was used inside a block. 
    Therefore even if it didn't pass, the block was printed
    (and it was not obvious what is going on).

  - set_var/fill_var
  
    There were two functions in previous versions, set_var and fill_var.
    The first did just foo=bar, the second ran it's arguments (command) and 
    set a variable to the command's stdout.

    Now it is more straightforward:

    @ Setting some fixed variables if this block passes
      - foo = bar
      - abc = xyz
    
    @ Storing stdout of commands to variables
      - output_to_var user_homes ls /home
      - output_to_var myip evaluate "host foo.com | grep has address"

    It also takes some options: --stdout, --stderr

    @ Storing only stderr of the command
      - output_to_var error_message --stderr ignore_errors find /nonexistent
      # or the same
      - output_to_var error_message -2 ignore_errors find /nonexistent
      - echo $error_message

  - output_to_file
  
    Similar function for storing an output of a command into a file.
    Moreover it accepts --append option to append data at the end of the file.

  - to register both exitcode and stdout of a command use a combination
    of 'result' and 'output_to_var' (just remember that the 'result' must preceede 'output_to_var'
    because it runs a sub-process, otherwise the variable won't get propagated to the parent process)

    @ Installing nginx
      - result installed output_to_var log apt-get install nginx
      - echo STORED OUTPUT: $log

    @ when installed
    @ Installation succeeded

    @ when not installed
    @ Error happened while installation, mailing the output
      - mail me@me.com <<< $log

  - renamed functions:

      may_fail  => ignore_errors
      toplevel  => is_toplevel
      var_empty => is_empty_var

  - shopt -s inherit_errexit by default

  - there were some other suggestions on modules (how to make them like ansible's)

    It will happen in a next version of bashible.
