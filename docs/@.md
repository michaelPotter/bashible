#### @ MESSAGE OR CONDITION

Represents
 a) a condition or
 b) a block of tasks executed if previous conditions match

The block sets the current working directory to the base dir (the default base dir is the same directory as the script resides in).

##### Example

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With conditions

```bash
@ when not which nginx
@ Installing nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With multiple conditions (OR)

```bash
@ when not which nginx
@ or not test -d /etc/nginx
@ Installing nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With multiple conditions (AND)

```bash
@ when test -d /sys
@ and test -d /dev
@ and test -d /proc
@ Probably on linux system
  - foo
  - bar
```

You can write also 'or when' and 'and when'.

If there are multiple 'when' in the beginning, it means AND.


Loops:

Sometimes you need to use a loop. The loop should be executed only if the condition of the block passes.
In this case, you have to use "-&&" (i.e. "- &&") which will do the job.

```bash

output_to_var DBS cat databases_to_install.txt

@ when not is_empty_var DBS
@ Installing databases
  -&& for db in $DBS; do yum_install $db; done
```
