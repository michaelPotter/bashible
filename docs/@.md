#### @ MESSAGE OR CONDITION

Represents a block of tasks.

The block sets the current working directory to the base dir (the default base dir is the same directory as the script resides in).

##### Example

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With conditions

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  when not which nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With multiple conditions (OR)

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  when not which nginx
  or not test -d /etc/nginx
  - yum_install nginx
```

With multiple conditions (AND)

```bash
@ Probably on linux system
  when test -d /sys
  and test -d /dev
  and test -d /proc
  - foo
  - bar
```

You can write also 'or when' and 'and when'.

If there are multiple 'when' in the beginning, it means AND.


Loops:

Sometimes you need to use a loop. The loop should be executed only if the condition of the block passes.
In this case, you have to use "-&&" (i.e. "- &&") which will do the job.

```bash

output_to_var DBS cat databases_to_install.txt

@ Installing databases
  when is not empty_var DBS
  -&& for db in $DBS; do yum_install $db; done
```
