#### - COMMAND [ARG1] [ARG2] ...

Represents a task. The task may be a command or a bash function. (Actually, the '-' itself is a bash function and everything that follows are arguments.)

When the command exits nonzero, further execution of the script (and all caller scripts) is halted and an error is displayed.

You can prefix it with [ignore_errors](ignore_errors.md) to avoid stopping execution, if the exitcode does not matter.

##### Example:

```bash
@ when not test -f /usr/bin/nginx   # set skipping mode if the test succeeds
@ Installing nginx
  - yum_install nginx                 # skipped if already
  - systemctl start nginx             # skipped if already

@ Purging temporary files if any      # now the skipping mode is off again
  - ignore_errors rm /tmp/temp1
  - ignore_errors rm /tmp/temp2
```

Conditional for / while loop or 'continue': 

Sometimes you need to use a loop. The loop should be executed only if the condition of the block passes.
In this case, you have to use "-&&" or "- &&"

```bash

output_to_var DBS cat databases_to_install.txt

@ when not is_empty_var DBS
@ Installing databases
  -&& for db in $DBS; do yum_install $db; done
```
